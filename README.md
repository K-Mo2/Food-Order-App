The application represents a menu of dishes with the price of each one.

It allows the user to order whichever the dishes they like in addition to the amount they want od each dish.

The user only needs to provide the app with their location and some presonal info to be able to reach them.

The data provided by the user is stored in Firebase including the delivery information and also the details of their order.
